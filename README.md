# Additify
a React Native app that I made with intention for people to be more aware of the chemicals they consumed every day.
## Features 🐱
- A database of food additives are available in the app (scraped with Python.)
- Camera-Text-Detection to scan a product's ingredients and identify the food additives that are available in the database (Tesseract OCR Engine)
## Future Plans 📝
- Keep track on how much food additives scanned and generate a health/risk report based on this.

### Purpose 💡
I was building this app initially to see how much I have improved my development skills compared to my previous React Native app (https://github.com/tanoto-the-explorer/Cook-Book) and realised that I improved my UI design skills, wrote cleaner and better code, improved my problem solving and googling skills, understand React Native more and fix the bugs faster. I made this in approximately 3 days with procrastination.
